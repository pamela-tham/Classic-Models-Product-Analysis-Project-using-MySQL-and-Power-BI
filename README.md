# üöó Classic Models Database Analysis üöó

Welcome to the **Classic Models Database Analysis** project! This project aims to analyze sales and performance data of a fictional company that sells classic car models. The data is sourced from the [MySQL Tutorial Sample Database](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql/mysql-sample-database/), which is widely used for learning relational database structures and SQL querying. 

Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into product performance, customer behaviour, and sales trends to support business decision-making.
